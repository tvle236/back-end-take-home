# Guestlogix Take Home Test - Backend

At Guestlogix we feel that putting developers on the spot with advanced algorithmic puzzles doesn’t exactly highlight one’s true skillset. The intention of this assessment is to see how you approach and tackle a problem in the real world, not quivering in front of a whiteboard.

### What is the test?

You will be building an endpoint that allows users to search a data set. Included in this repository is a set of Airport, Airline, and Route data. Your task is to create models to represent, relate and ultimately expose the data to a GET endpoint. Users of the API will be able to search for routes given an origin and destination.

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can make a GET request to an endpoint with an `origin` and `destination` query parameter, and receive back the shortest route between the two, as an array of connecting flights. A shortest route is defined as the route with the fewest connections. If there are mulitple routes with the same number of connections, you may choose any of them. 
- As a user I am provided meaningful feedback should no route exist between the airports.
- As a user I am provided meaningful feedback if an error occurred with my request.

### Getting Started

For this test you can use any technology you want... seriously. Node.js? Do it. .NET? Send it. PHP? That still exists? Basically, the point is, use whatever you want, really, no need to try and impress us with a new tech if you aren’t familiar with it, use what you like, anyone can learn a new framework. The only downside is because we want to leave this up to you, we can’t really boilerplate the build steps and such for you, so that adds a little bit of time for you... sorry.
